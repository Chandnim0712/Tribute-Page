           <p> 1914: A <strong>Star</strong> is born.</p>


            <p>As a child, Lamarr was always interested in 
            acting and was very fascinated by theatre and 
            film. At the age of 12, she won a beauty contest 
            in Vienna. I think this was among the moments 
            that really steered her towards her journey to 
            Hollywood.</p>
            
            <p>The Golden Age of Hollywood created some of the 
                best-known celebrities in the history of moving 
                pictures. Marilyn Monroe, Rita Hayworth, Lauren 
                Bacall, Audrey Hepburn―these are just some of 
                the household names.</p>
            
            <p>But in the early days of Hollywood, one woman 
                was considered the most beautiful of them 
                all–and later proved to be much, much more. 
                Hedy Lamarr, an Austrian-born actress, starred 
                in a number of black-and-white box-office hits, 
                like the 1941 Ziegfeld Girl and Experiment 
                Perilous in 1944.</p>
            
            <p>Something interesting abou her is that she was not 
                just a pretty face on the screens but was also a 
                <strong>self taught scientist</strong>. She was an admirable woman 
                who not only made films worth watching But also 
                came up with some cutting edge technology that 
                later led to the invention of Wi-Fi and GPS. Pretty 
                dope huh!</p>
            
            <p>The most beautiful woman in the world had experience 
               with military equipment because her ex-husband, 
               from whom she fled due to his staunch support for 
               the Nazi Party, was an ammunition manufacturer, deeply 
               involved with the arms industry of the Third Reich.</p>
            
            <p>She became familiar with the developing weapons 
                industry of the time, so much so that she could 
                pinpoint the weak spots within military technology 
                that could be corrected.</p>
            
            <p>At the time, the radio-guided torpedoes that used 
                wireless technology were easily jammed by enemy 
                frequency, causing the missile to divert its course. 
                Together with Antheil, she saw an opportunity to 
                develop a device capable of effectively overcoming 
                any jamming distributed by the enemy. Using a principle 
                based on the paper player piano rolls, the signal would 
                constantly be “hopping,” becoming impossible to track.</p>
            
            <p>The principle enabled the jamming-resistant torpedo 
                to use 88 possible frequencies, for that was the number 
                of keys on a piano, creating a random code, known only 
                to the controller of the torpedo. In this way, the 
                signal became highly resilient to jamming and almost 
                impossible to intercept.</p>
            
            <p> Even though experiments involving the spread-spectrum 
                radio were conducted in the early 20th century, with 
                discoveries even being implemented by the German Army 
                during World War I, the novel approach of using the 
                piano principle and the exact role of the device was 
                solely Lamar’s and Antheil’s invention.</p>
